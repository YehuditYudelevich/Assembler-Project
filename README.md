Project Description
Assembler Project is designed to develop a simulator for an assembler. The project includes source code and data for use with an assembler system, aiming to demonstrate and understand the process of converting assembly code to binary.

The project features:

Source Code in C for implementing the simulator, including functions for processing, error analysis, and binary code generation.
Example Assembly Files that allow testing the system with different scenarios.
Output Files showing the results obtained from the simulator for various assembly files.
